    <h2>Samoyeds smile for a reason 

        The Samoyed smile is iconic: their black gums stark against their white fur, turned up in a happy little grin 24-7. But Samoyeds don't smile because it's cute - they do it because of evolution. They upturned mouth prevents the Samoyeds from drooling out of the corner of their mouths, which ultimately prevents drool icicles from forming in the frigid temperatures of their homeland.  </h2>
