          The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
          descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived
          from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's
          nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be
          domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the
          development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans,
          dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and
          gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
          inadequate for other canids. The dog has been selectively bred over
          millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
          attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They
          perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling
          loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship,
          therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became
          uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been
          a topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given
          them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

            A dog’s nose print is unique, much like a person’s fingerprint.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Forty-five percent of U.S. dogs sleep in their owner’s bed.</li>
          <br />

            Speaking of sleeping … all dogs dream, but puppies and senior dogs
            dream more frequently than adult dogs.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Seventy percent of people sign their dog’s name on their holiday

            A dog’s sense of smell is legendary, but did you know that his nose
            has as many as 300 million receptors? In comparison, a human nose
            has about 5 million.
